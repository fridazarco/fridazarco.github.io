I am a computer animation and game art student at CSUF and I expect to graduate in 2025.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 4, part 2

  Lab 4, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because the hilo.cc program was the first lab that I was able to understand without asking for help. This lab helped me have a better understanding of how to use operators in C++, specifically using the greater than, less than, and equal to operators. This lab showed me that as long as I continue learning C++, I can get better at understanding how to do the lab assignments.

* Lab 6, part 1

  Lab 6, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it was one of the easiest labs I’ve ever done. The sandwich.cc program introduced command line arguments and showed a different way to run a program by using multiple arguments following the ./sandwich shell command. This lab also introduced me to the use of vectors and .size(), which are used in later lab assignments.

* Lab 8, part 2

  Lab 8, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because I gained a new understanding of for loops. By using the ./pattern command, I was able to see what the outcome was so that I would be able to fix any errors in order for the pattern to match the expected outcome. The pattern.cc program also gave me insight into how for loops can make different patterns using numbers, characters, and/or symbols and display them in the terminal.
